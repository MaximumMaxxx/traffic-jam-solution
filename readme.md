This is a smallish solution to the traffic jam problem. This repo mostly exists to send to my teacher.

## How to run

clone the repo then run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

you'll be asked for the number of players and after that it will write the steps to the console and to a file called `{players}.txt` where `{players}` is the number of players you entered.
